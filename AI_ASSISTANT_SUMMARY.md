# AI Assistant Summary — dth-score

## Snapshot / purpose
This file summarizes recent work done while pairing on the dth-score project. Keep this file in the repo so you or any collaborator can resume quickly if the chat history isn't preserved by the editor.

## High-level changes made
- Immediate, low-latency draft flow:
  - Scorecard emits lightweight per-hole draft events so leaderboards can update instantly.
  - Leaderboard (`AllianceLeaderboard.jsx`) consumes `score-draft-updated` and `client-team-user-updated` events and merges drafts into its `entries` state.
- Handicaps (CH/PH) reconciliation:
  - Client tries to resolve `course_handicap` from group handicaps, then per-team `teams_users` rows, then falls back to server `/api/competitions/:id/leaderboard-4bbb` endpoint.
  - Negative-cache added to avoid repeated 404s when `teams/:teamId/users/:userId` doesn't exist.
- Individual Stableford support:
  - `AllianceLeaderboard.jsx` updated to treat Individual Stableford competitions as one-player teams and rank players by Stableford totals.
- Mobile scorecard parity:
  - `MedalScorecard.jsx` mobile rendering now reuses the Alliance/4BBB compact mobile UI for Individual Stableford (no separate mobile block), so mobile scorecard UX is consistent across comp types.
- Defensive fixes:
  - Fixed a build-time/parse error by balancing previously mismatched braces and making the socket handler `async` where required.

## Files I edited (important ones)
- `frontend/src/AllianceLeaderboard.jsx`
  - Added Individual Stableford ranking (one-player-per-team), negative-cache for missing `teams_users` rows, draft merge handlers, and conservative name/user matching for CH mapping.
- `frontend/src/MedalScorecard.jsx`
  - Adjusted mobile rendering branch to include Individual Stableford in the compact mobile entry UI (reused Alliance/4BBB mobile layout).

Note: minor debug exposures (`window.__dth_ui_teams`, `window.__dth_backendTeamPointsMap`) were used during development; remove if you don't want them in prod.

## How this helps when you reopen the project
- If the VS Code chat or extension doesn't persist this conversation, this file provides the essential context and next steps so you can re-open the code and continue quickly.

## How to test locally (quick smoke)
1. Start backend (from repo root):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node index.js
```

2. Start frontend (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open two browser windows (or device + desktop):
   - Open a Scorecard URL (e.g. `/scorecard/<compId>`) on mobile/emulated mobile.
   - Open the Leaderboard URL (`/leaderboard/<compId>`) on desktop.
   - Edit CH or per-hole scores on the scorecard and verify leaderboard updates immediately.

Notes: If you run into Tailwind/lightningcss native-binary issues on build, set `LIGHTNING_CSS_FORCE_WASM=1` before `npm run build` (see `frontend/vite.config.js` fallback).

## Remaining / recommended tasks (prioritized)
1. Client rebroadcast dedupe (high):
   - Ignore server rebroadcasts that include `originSocketId === socket.id` to avoid double-processing drafts you originated.
   - Location: `frontend/src/AllianceLeaderboard.jsx` realtime handlers (check `msg.originSocketId`).
2. Server-side authoritative CH in rebroadcasts (high):
   - When server rebroadcasts draft updates, include authoritative `course_handicap` in the payload to reduce client fetches.
   - Location: `backend/index.js` socket emission path for client/team-user updates.
3. E2E smoke tests (medium):
   - Run the smoke steps above and verify: CH propagation, Net/DTH Net (= gross - PH / gross - CH), and Individual Stableford points.
4. Clean-up (low):
   - Remove any temporary console/debug exposures.
   - Add small tests/snapshots for mobile view rendering if you want to lock UX.

## Quick notes about resume strategy
- If the chat window is restored by your editor/extension, it will include the full conversation history (depending on that platform's persistence). If not:
  - This file contains the minimal state and next tasks.
  - Re-run the `processCompetitionPayload` flow by opening a leaderboard URL so the code re-runs the CH reconciliation.
  - If you need me to re-scan the code when you reopen, paste this file or point me at `AI_ASSISTANT_SUMMARY.md` and I will re-load relevant source files.

## Who to contact / references
- Backend main: `backend/index.js` (server socket emissions / rebroadcasts)
- Leaderboard UI: `frontend/src/AllianceLeaderboard.jsx`
- Scorecard UI: `frontend/src/MedalScorecard.jsx`

If you want, I can also create a tiny smoke-test script or add a `README-smoke.md` with the exact test URLs and sample compId values.
